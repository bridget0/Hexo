title: Contributing

---

There is a lot to do on a project like this, so all people willing to help are welcome. The project is still in its early stage of development, so do not expect a stable context, we are moving forward as fast as possible.

We've just begun using the "Trello" organizational tool to make a board of cards that are Ideas for Red Contributors. So go look at that, as it will likely come to be updated more frequently than this page!

But speaking generally, if you want to contribute at the source code level:
<ul>
	<li>We are at the bootstrapping phase, the whole compilation tool-chain is written in Rebol v2, so knowing this language is mandatory to make contribution to the compiler or linker. The good thing is: as Red will be very close to Rebol's syntax, your newly acquired knowledge will not be lost...and will help you be operational on Red at soon as it will be available.</li>
	<li>The low-level Red/System DSL is at beta stage, but we still need:
		<ul>
			<li>testing: writing small apps, reporting issues, writing more unit tests,...</li>
			<li>bindings to useful low-level libraries</li>
			<li>larger applications (to help improve Red/System's programming-in-the-large abilities)</li></ul></li>
	<li>Install Git, learn how to use it (we can help for that), and open a Github account, then fork the Red project repository. When you are ready to propose some new source code or patches, send a pull request.</li>
</ul>

But working on the codebase itself isn't the only help we need. Notice that this website is not very fancy? We're in the midst of migrating the content out of blogger and doing a custom rebuild, here's a test deployment of the scrape. It's just a start...are you a HTML+CSS master, can you help us make it better? Our hope is to shift the whole thing to be maintained in GitHub, the way ruby-lang does it.

If you want to join the party, contact us through one of the preferred ways listed above, or drop an email to: contrib (at) red-lang.org
